1. Go back to the WIN1 virtual machine.

1. Launch Windows PowerShell as Administrator by right clicking the Start menu icon and selecting **Windows PowerShell (Admin)**.
1. Paste the command which we copied from the Native SSH window
1. Enter **yes** to confirm the connection and then type the user's **password provided under Resource group: LIN1** in the Environment tab of Lab Guide and press **enter**. Your screen should look something like this:

   ![linux login](../Media/ch-4.5.png)

   > **Note**: When a command prompts for a password, the characters are hidden for security. You can simply type your password and press Enter, even though nothing appears on the screen.

1. Paste command **1.2 Install the CEF collector on the Linux machine** you have copied in earlier step. 

   ![ConnectorScript](../Media/ConnectorScriptupdated.png)

1. The script will run against your Linux server remotely. When the script processes properly it should look like this screen:

   ![ConnectorScript](../Media/LinuxConnectedupd.png)
   
1. Close the Powershell Window.

### Task 2: Connect a Linux host using the Syslog connector

   > **Note:** Perform this task from the SmartHotelHost VM (Lab VM).

In this task, you will connect a Linux host to Microsoft Sentinel with the Syslog connector.

1. In the Search bar of the Azure portal, type **Sentinel (1)**, then select **Microsoft Sentinel (2)**.

   ![](../Media/ee6.png) 

1. Click on the **workspace-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />** that we created earlier.

   > **Note:** If you see an error that the page was moved to Defender portal, click on the link on the left top side to access the old experience and refresh the browser page. 

      ![](../Media/sentinel-error-1401.png) 

1. Select **Content Hub (1)** under Content management from the left pane.

1. Search for **Syslog (2)** and select **(3)** it. Once selected, click on **Install (4)**.

   ![](../Media/L5T2S4-1301.png)  

1. Once the **Syslog** connector is installed, click on **Manage**.

1. Select the **Syslog via AMA (1)** from the list and click on **Open connector page (2)**.

   ![](../Media/L5T2S6.1-1301.png)  

1. Under **Configuration**, click on **+ Create data collection rule**.

   ![](../Media/L5T2S7-1301.png)  

1. On the Create Data Collection Rule page, for the **Name**, enter **WINDCR2 (1)** and click on **Next: Resources (2)**.

   ![](../Media/L5T2S8-1301.png)

1. On the **Resources** page, select the Lin-2 VM under the Lin-2 resource group, and click on **Next: Collect (2)**.

   ![](../Media/L5T2S9-1301.png)

1. On the **Collect** page, keep everything as default and click on **Next: Review + create**.

1. On the **Review + create** page, review the settings and click on **Create**.

### Task 3: Configure Syslog facilities and severities using Data Collection Rules

   > **Note:** Perform this task from the SmartHotelHost VM (Lab VM).

In this task, you will update the **Data Collection Rule (DCR)** created in the previous task to specify the **Syslog facilities** and severity levels to be collected from Linux machines and sent to Microsoft Sentinel.

1. On the search bar, search for **Data collection rule (1)** and select it **(2)**.

   ![](../Media/L5T3S1-1301.png)

1. Select the **WINDCR2** data collection rule from the list.

1. In the Add data source page, select the following **(1)** facilities and click on **Save (2)**:
   - LOG_AUTH
   - LOG_AUTHPRIV

       ![](../Media/L5T3S4-1301.png)

   >**Note:** You can also select Minimum log level for both facilities.

## Summary 

In this lab, you learned how to connect Linux hosts to Microsoft Sentinel using the Common Event Format (CEF) and Syslog connectors. You also configured the facilities for the Syslog connector.

### You have successfully completed this lab!

By completing this lab **Secure Windows Servers with Azure Arc & Microsoft Defender**, you gained hands-on experience in strengthening hybrid cloud environments using Microsoft security and monitoring tools. You began by onboarding on-premises Windows Servers to Azure Arc, enabling centralized governance and management across hybrid infrastructures. You then configured Microsoft Defender for Cloud to monitor workloads, assess compliance, and mitigate threats through actionable security alerts. Moving further, you connected Windows and Linux machines to Microsoft Sentinel using data connectors such as CEF and Syslog, integrating diverse log sources for advanced threat detection and response. Through this process, you built a unified security architecture that leverages AI-driven intelligence, automated incident handling, and comprehensive visibility to safeguard both on-premises and cloud resources.
